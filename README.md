# betRBall

**betRBall** is an R package for football betting calculations and visualizations.  

## ðŸ“¦ Included Functions

Currently, the package contains the following core functions:

- `poisson_goal_grid()`: Generates a matrix of goal outcome probabilities for two teams using Poisson distribution.
- `asian_handicap_odds()`: Calculates Asian handicap odds (e.g., -0.75, +1.5) using a matrix of goal outcome probabilities such as from `poisson_goal_grid()`.
- `asian_total_odds()`: Calculates odds for Asian total goals lines (e.g., over/under 2.5, 3.25) using a matrix of goal outcome probabilities.
- `sim_bets()`: Simulates betting outcomes over multiple bets and simulations to estimate expected profit and variance.



## ðŸ”§ Installation

You can install the development version of `betRBall` from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("willewiik/betRBall")
```

## ðŸ“Š Example 1

```{r example}
library(betRBall)

# Generate a Poisson goal probability grid with expected goals for home and away teams
grid <- poisson_goal_grid(exp_home = 1.5, exp_away = 1.2)

# Calculate Asian handicap odds for line -0.25
handicap_odds <- asian_handicap_odds(grid = grid, line = -0.25)
print(handicap_odds)
# [1] 1.934441 2.070158

# Calculate Asian total goals odds for line 3.25
total_odds <- asian_total_odds(grid = grid, line = 3.25)
print(total_odds)
[1] 3.064306 1.484424
```



## ðŸ“Š Example 2

```{r example}
library(betRBall)

# Run a simulation with:
# - 1000 bets
# - 500 simulations
# - 5% edge 
result <- sim_bets(n_bets = 1000, n_sim = 500, edge = 1.05)

# Plot the cumulative profit across all simulations
result[["profit_plot"]]

# Plot the distribution of odds used in the simulations
result[["odds_plot"]]

```
